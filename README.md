# Effects-of-Genetic-Network-Topology-on-Supercoiling-Influenced-Transcription

final code for the final project of BioE 211 "quantiative methods in biology".

this code allows for the stochastic simulation of arbitrary genome topologies with the influence of supercoiling. Thhe user can define a "genome", with user specifed genes and orientations,the simulation then stochasticallysomulates the genome and plot the mRNA output overtime. In addition the code provides an animation of the global supercliling fjunction over time.

the mathematical model we used is a simplified version of the model from Johnstone CP, Galloway KE's paper "Supercoiling-mediated feedback rapidly couples and tunes transcription", in which we abstratced most of the first principle physics based derivations, through tactical use of aproximation functions (certain radial basis and sigmoidal functions.)
